# its an app about music
Do you dislike using ONLY ONE App for listening to music and queing songs?
Then we have the Solution for you: Jive
Jive is an App which allows the user to create a Jive Playlist where people can join and add songs to the queue from different platforms like Spotify, YouTube or local MP3 files. The music is then played on the host device, which can be connected to an external speaker.

# How is this working??
We use API keys to connect to the different platforms.
We create a network between devices over a relay server, so they can communicate with each other.
If you are the host, you can create a jive and share a QR-code or Jive ID, so others can join.
If you want to join, scan a QR-Code or insert a Jive ID. You also have to enter a name, so that one knows whos music is playing. And then simply join!

# What features does it have
- Searching music cross platform
- Adding music to a queue from different devices

# You think this is cool?
Then we are glad you like it. We had much fun (sometimes frustrated) creating it!
